# MAC_Address_Scraper
Scrapes MAC Addresses from a text file and provides info like the manufacturer.

This program will require you to put all the text with the MAC Addresses in a separate text file in the same directory as the program if you don't want to put the path in. The program will also print the manufacturer info beside the MAC Address. If there are any issues, it's probably an internet connectivity issue because I am using another website, maclookup.app, for the OUI identification.
Program only works on Linux btw

To the website creators, thank you for making my life easier.
