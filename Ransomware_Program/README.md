#This is a ransomware program

The file Ransomware.py will encrypt the file called file_to_test_ransomware.txt by generating a key and using it to encrypt the file.

The key will then be saved in a file called thekey.key. 

Decryptor.py will decrypt file_to_test_ransomware.txt by extracting the key from the thekey.key file.

Ransomware.py will only encrypt the file file_to_test_ransomware.txt.

This is to make sure none of you accidentally encrypt your other files. 


This is a very basic ransomware program so don't expect much from it.


Disclaimer: I am not responsible for anything bad that results out of this. If you mess up and encrypt your files
to the point of no recovery or use this to cause harm, that's on you.
