#This is a password manager

This program is a password manager. When signing up for a website, open the program and run it to get a new password.
Use the password for the website and add your username to the program. The program will save the credentials in a file called passwords.txt 
which will be located where Password_Manager.py is. You can change the location of file creation and file name on line 16. Keep in mind that
deleting the password file will result in losing all your passwords.
