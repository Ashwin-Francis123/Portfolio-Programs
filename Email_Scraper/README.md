# Email_Scraper
Add a file using the -f switch and the program will return all the emails in the file

Keep in mind that this only allows .txt files. Copy the text on the document you want to scrape and put it in a text file.

Then scrape the text file instead. Unfortunately, you will need to put the file in the same directory as the program because it only works if 

the text file is in the same directory as the program. You guys can go find a workaround for that or something.

The output will be a file called Scraped_Emails.txt. 

If a file called Scraped_Emails.txt already exists, the data in it gets replaced with the output from the program.

This only works on linux btw.
